# HairyDolphins
## Team 49

HairyDolphins is a web app that connects travellers with local people, who are willing to spend a day (or even a few hours) working as a tourist guide, to help tourists get the best experience of their travel. Until today, tourist guide is a professional occupation and most of the guides are affiliated with travel agencies, so it is very difficult for independent travellers to find a local companion who can travel alongside with. Our idea is that everyone can work as a tourist guide, as long as he/she is a local resident, preferably bilingual, and is enthusiastic about taking visitors to interesting places. Our app is going to change the way of finding a tourist guide to the way that you book a taxi or request a Uber cab -- easy, fast, and reliable.
